# üåç Beyond Swarm Notebooks

The rest of these pages provide views of the central *Swarm Notebooks* which aim to document access to Swarm products and show general recipes for their manipulation and visualisation. These are tested and verified to work on the VRE.

What about other projects beyond the scope of *Swarm Notebooks*? On this page we collect a list of related repositories, with links to view them statically online and to pull them into the VRE to interact with them.
