# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Hello! Welcome to **Swarm Notebooks** - a community resource to help people make use of the product portfolio from [**ESA's Swarm mission**](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/swarm) using the Python ecosystem. Here you will find recipes and guidance in using Swarm data in conjunction with the [**VirES**](https://vires.services) data retrieval system and the [**Virtual Research Environment (VRE)**](https://vre.vires.services).

## How to use this resource

Some of these pages are generated from Jupyter notebooks which can be interacted with on the VRE - on those pages you will see a ðŸš€ rocket button at the top. Hover over that button and select *JupyterHub* to launch the notebook interactively (after first creating a free account). The notebooks are also available within the VRE already, baked into the notebook launcher.
