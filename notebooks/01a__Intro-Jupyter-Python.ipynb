    "## Jupyter basics\n",
    "\n",
    "A *Jupyter notebook* is a file (extension .ipynb) which can contain both (live) code and its outputs, as well as explanatory text. Content is organised into *cells*, where each cell may be either *Code* or [*Markdown*](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) (or others). A notebook can be rendered non-interactively in a web browser, converted to other formats (HTML, PDF ...), or can be run interactively through a range of software. The standard software is JupyterLab which can be interacted with in a web browser, while the server backend (where the code itself runs) can be run either locally on your own machine, or on a remote machine as is the case with the [*Virtual Research Environment (VRE)*](https://swarm-vre.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html). A notebook must be connected to a *kernel* which provides the software executable used to run code within the notebook (see the top right \"Python 3\" in JupyterLab). When accessing the VRE, your Python code and data associated with a notebook are stored and running on a remote machine - you only view the inputs and outputs from the code such that data transfer over the internet to your web browser is minimal. The main advantage is that there is zero setup required - all you need is a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "When running interactively, notebook cells can be added, deleted, edited, and executed using buttons in JupyterLab and with keyboard shortcuts. Double click on this text to see the raw Markdown - re-render it by running the cell: use the \"play\" button at the top or use **Ctrl-Enter** (run) or **Shift-Enter** (run and advance to the next cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook switches between two modes: **command** and **edit**. Enter edit mode by double clicking inside a cell, or by pressing **Enter**. Enter command mode by pressing **Esc** and then the notebook can be navigated with the arrow keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cell is set to \"Code\". Run the cell - you should see that the output of the last line of the cell is displayed as the output of the cell. This is a convenient way to check the state of variables rather than having to use `print()` as below. To suppress this behaviour, end the line with`;`\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells can be run in any order and the memory is persistent - see the incrementing counter `[1]`, `[2]` on the left - so be careful when you run (or re-run) cells out of order!"

    "The demonstrations above show that there are quite a few lines of code necessary to do the typical data analysis flow of loading/generating data, performing some computation, and plotting the results, in addition to having to pass around variables (like `x` and `y` above). This code may very often be quite similar so you might imagine standardising this process. It is for this reason that [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html) has become popular, which provides the `DataFrame` object (inspired by the R language). This enables us to create a single tabular object to pass around (called `df` below) that contains our data (in this case numpy arrays), that has built-in plotting methods to rapidly inspect the data (creating matplotlib figures). Pandas accepts a wide range of input formats to load data, and contains computational tools that are particularly useful for time series, as well as connecting to [**Dask**](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/why.html) for doing larger computations (larger than memory, multi-process, distributed etc.)."
