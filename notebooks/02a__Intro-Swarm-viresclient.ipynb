    "In order to authenticate access to the VirES server, `viresclient` requires an access token - this ties communications between the server and the client to your account. **If you are using the VRE, this is handled automatically so you can skip this step.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are running `viresclient` on a different machine, you will need to follow these instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a user account at https://vires.services if you haven't already done so\n",
    "2. Install viresclient in your Python environment - see https://viresclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html\n",
    "3. Create a new code cell here and execute the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from viresclient import set_token\n",
    "   set_token(\"https://vires.services/ows\", set_default=True)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You will now be directed to the [VirES token management page](https://vires.services/accounts/tokens/), and prompted to generate a new token and enter it here\n",
    "\n",
    "Your access token should now have been saved to your environment and you won't need to provide it again. The token and its associated access URL are stored in a file: `~/.viresclient.ini` (this file can also be edited directly). You may generate and set a new token, or revoke old tokens, at any point. These are similar to passwords, so **should be kept secret** - if you accidentally leak a token, you can revoke it at the token management page and generate a new one. It is also possible to set access tokens via CLI. For more information, see https://viresclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_details.html\n",
